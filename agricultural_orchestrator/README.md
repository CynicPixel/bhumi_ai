# 🌾 Agricultural Intelligence Orchestrator

An advanced AI-powered agricultural router that provides comprehensive agricultural support through intelligent agent card-based routing and multimodal query analysis for Indian farmers.

## 🎯 Overview

The Agricultural Intelligence Orchestrator is an advanced agricultural routing system that:
- **Smart Agent Routing**: Primary function - routes queries to specialized agents based on dynamic agent card skill matching
- **Multimodal Analysis**: Supports text and image inputs for comprehensive query understanding before routing
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Coordinates multiple specialist agents for complex queries spanning multiple domains
- **Dynamic Agent Discovery**: Uses real-time agent card querying for intelligent routing decisions
- **Fallback Intelligence**: Provides direct analysis only when routing is not feasible

## 🏗️ Architecture

Multimodal Query → Router Analysis → Agent Card Skill Matching → Intelligent Routing → Synthesis
                                                                        ↓
                                                               Market Agent (Port 10006)
                                                               Weather Agent (Port 10005) 
                                                               Schemes Agent (Port 10004)
                                                                        ↓
                                                          Multi-Agent Response Synthesis
```

```
"Plan my crop rotation for the next 6 months in Bihar"
"When should I start preparing for monsoon crops in Kerala?"
"Best crops to plant in Rajasthan this season considering market and weather"
```

### Regional Comparison

```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Port Configuration
- **Orchestrator Agent**: Port 10007
- **Market Agent**: Port 10006 (existing)
- **Weather Agent**: Port 10005 (existing)

### Environment Variables
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY`: Required for Gemini model access
- `GOOGLE_MODEL_NAME`: Gemini model to use (default: gemini-2.0-flash-exp)
- `MARKET_AGENT_URL`: URL of the Market Intelligence Agent
- `WEATHER_AGENT_URL`: URL of the Weather Agent
- `HOST`: Host to bind the server to

## 🔄 How It Works

1. **Query Reception**: User sends natural language agricultural query
2. **Intent Analysis**: Orchestrator analyzes query to determine required agents
3. **Agent Coordination**: Queries relevant specialized agents concurrently
4. **Response Collection**: Gathers responses from market and weather agents
5. **Synthesis**: Combines responses into coherent agricultural advice
6. **Delivery**: Presents unified, actionable farming recommendations

## 📤 Message Format to Specialized Agents

When the orchestrator communicates with your specialized agents, it sends messages in this format:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "message/send",
  "params": {
    "message": {
      "messageId": "unique_id",
      "role": "user",
      "parts": [{"text": "Your query here"}],
      "metadata": {
        "user_id": "orchestrator_user",
        "session_id": "session_id"
      }
    }
  },
  "id": "request_id"
}
```

This ensures compatibility with your existing Market and Weather agents.

## 🌟 Key Benefits

- **Comprehensive Insights**: Combines market and weather data for holistic analysis
- **Farmer-Friendly**: Provides practical, actionable advice in clear language
- **Intelligent Routing**: Automatically determines which agents to involve
- **Real-Time Data**: Leverages live market and weather information
- **Regional Context**: Tailored advice for Indian agricultural regions
- **Scalable Architecture**: Easy to add new specialized agents

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No agents available"**
   - Ensure Market and Weather agents are running
   - Check agent URLs in .env file
   - Verify agent ports are accessible

2. **"GOOGLE_API_KEY not set"**
   - Set GOOGLE_API_KEY in your .env file
   - Get API key from [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/)

3. **Connection timeouts**
   - Check if specialized agents are responding
   - Verify network connectivity
   - Adjust timeout values in .env if needed

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by modifying the logging level in the code:
```python
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

## 🔗 API Endpoints

The orchestrator exposes standard A2A endpoints:
- `/.well-known/agent.json`: Agent capabilities and metadata
- `/message/send`: Send messages to the orchestrator
- `/tasks/{task_id}`: Task status and updates
